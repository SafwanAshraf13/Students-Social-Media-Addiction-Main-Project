# Students-Social-Media-Addiction-Main-Project

This project explores how social media usage affects students’ sleep patterns, addiction levels, and overall digital well-being. 
It includes feature engineering, data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation based on a dataset of student social media habits.

Technologies Used : 
Python 3
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook.

> The goal of this project is to analyze how social media behavior impacts students by examining :

1.Addiction Score

2.Sleep Hours

3.Social Media Usage

4.Country

5.Derived features

6.Behavioral patterns and risks.

This project performs a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden trends, correlations, and insights.

> Derived Features Created :

During analysis, several new meaningful features were created:

Sleep_Deficit → Recommended sleep hours (8) minus actual sleep

Addiction_Category → Categorized as Mild, Moderate, or Severe based on score

SM_Hours_per_Sleep_Hour → Ratio of social media hours to sleep hours

SM_Sleep_Category → Balanced / Slightly Imbalanced / High Imbalance / Severe Risk

> Acknowledgements

This project was created for educational purposes to explore digital health, behavioral analytics, and student well-being.
